# Running & Output
## Installation
The MARS framework is written in C#/.NET, so you need to install the:
- [.NET-SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) on your computer to develop MARS models.
- [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This will handle the installation of .NET for you and give an easy way to execute and debug your models. Though a license is required for using Rider, which is [free for students](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).

## Configuration & Running
The model is configured via the config.json file in the root folder of the einp-model. For more information on configuration and excecution please read [MARS documentation](https://www.mars-group.org/docs/tutorial/configuration/sim_config_options).
The execution of the simulation is defined globally (global real-time based execution). 

## Viewing the output
After you run the model, by hitting the Build-Taks in JetBrains Raider (small green triangle in the upper right of the IDE), the simulation will run, and produce outputs.
