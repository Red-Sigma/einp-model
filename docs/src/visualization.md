# Visualization
## Visualizing the model output
The vector data and the movement of the Bison agents is stored in a file named `Bison_trips.geojson`, the movement of `Moose_trips.geojson` and the movement of the Elk agents is stored in a file named `Elk_trips.geojson`. 

The movement trajectories can be visualized in [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/demo). 

Below is a screenshot of the visualization output.
